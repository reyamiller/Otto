Before starting to work with Otto, make sure you have the `Opentrons app <https://opentrons.com/ot-app>`_ installed.

To run a protocol:

If you're using a pre-written protocol, make sure to read through the protocol file and make any necessary changes to the code. If it's a protocol I've written, I strongly recommend reading the documentation for it!

For further help setting up, I recommend the Opentrons Python Protocol API V2 `tutorial <https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/tutorial.html#tutorial>`.
