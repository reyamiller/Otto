Getting Started

Before starting to work with Otto, make sure you have the `Opentrons app <https://opentrons.com/ot-app>`_ installed.

To run a protocol:

    If you're using a pre-written protocol, make sure to read through the protocol file and make any necessary changes to the code. If it's a protocol I've written, I strongly recommend reading the documentation for it!

    Make sure you're connected to the robot.
    
    Download the protocol file and import it into the Opentrons app.

    Click ``Start setup``.
