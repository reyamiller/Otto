Setting Up
==========

Basic Use
---------

Make sure to install the `Opentrons App <https://opentrons.com/ot-app>`_.

You'll also want to familiarize yourself with the robot, such as by looking at the `Get Started page <https://support.opentrons.com/s/ot2-get-started>`_.

From here you just need to download your desired protocol and upload it to the OT app, and it should be ready to run.
